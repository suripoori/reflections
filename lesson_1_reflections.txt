How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
fc helped identify the exact lines in the code where the two files differed. 
This helped in quickly pinpointing the bug in the new version

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I do not have to worry about keeping different version under different filenames.
A version control system will save different versions of the files.
This helps me to quickly revert to an older version if I made any mistakes in the new version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Pros: Allows for one logical change per commit formula to be used.
Cons: User may forget to commit some changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Logical changes can span multiple files in code. So, tracking those changes in one commit is better.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log lists all the changes which were made in that directory. 
git diff can be used with commit ids to see the differences between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Using version control gives me the confidence that even if I break something, there is a working version to which I can revert to.
