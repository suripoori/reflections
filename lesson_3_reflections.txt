When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When there are multiple users working on the same project or when I want to work on a different computer and commit those changes,
it is better to host the file in github or any such remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If I'm working on a particular code base and building something, I may not want changes which others pushed in to remote getting pulled
automatically as it may break my changes. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is used when you want to take an existing github repository owned by someone else, and modify it. Git creates a new
remote repository for you which you can modify.
Clone is used when you want a remote repository to be downloaded to your local computer, so that you can edit it.
Branches are used when you want to make experimental changes to a local repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Other options to collaborate include Google drive/dropbox etc. But, github is the easiest to use to collaborate for code.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When I want to add a new feature or put in a hotfix, it makes sense to start work on a new branch forked out of master. 
Commit and Push the changes and then once tested, send a pull-request for the same.
