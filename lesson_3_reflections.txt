When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When there are multiple users working on the same project or when I want to work on a different computer and commit those changes,
it is better to host the file in github or any such remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If I'm working on a particular code base and building something, I may not want changes which others pushed in to remote getting pulled
automatically as it may break my changes.
