What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When a repository is initialized, git creates a repository to allow for me to select the files to be tracked

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area allows me to add the files which need to be tracked by a commit. If there are changes to multiple files
which need to go into a single commit(logical change), then it makes more sense to add all those files into the staging
area and then commit everything in the staging area with one commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change
